# mamiu dotfiles

This is the repository of the config files, I need on every system.
I manage my config files with [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick), an awesome git dotfiles synchronizer written in bash.

## Requirements

The only requirement for this dotfiles repository is to have a Powerline compatible font like [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) or the [patched fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) from the Powerline project installed and setup in your terminal emulator.

## Installation

Just run the following line in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sL install.miu.io | bash
```

> :warning: **If you want to setup a Mac:**
>
> Make sure that all macOS updates are installed (System Preferences â†’ Software Updates) before running the install script to prevent package version mismatch.
