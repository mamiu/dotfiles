# mamius' dotfiles

This is the repository of the config files, I need on every system.
I manage my config files with [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick), an awesome git dotfiles synchronizer written in bash.

## Installation

Just run the following line in your terminal:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mamiu/dotfiles/master/install/install.sh | bash -s -- -l
```

That's all! Have fun :tada:
